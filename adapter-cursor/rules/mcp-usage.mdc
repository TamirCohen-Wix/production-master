# MCP Server Usage

Production-master relies on 9 MCP servers for data collection and actions.
Every agent that uses MCP tools MUST receive the corresponding skill file
content in its prompt.

## MCP Servers

| # | Server Name | Purpose |
|---|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **octocode** | GitHub code search, file content, repo structure, PR search |
| 2 | **Slack** | Slack channel and thread search, message retrieval |
| 3 | **jira** | Jira ticket read/write, comment posting |
| 4 | **grafana-datasource** | Grafana SQL queries for logs, errors, metrics |
| 5 | **FT-release** | Feature toggle release lifecycle queries |
| 6 | **github** | GitHub API operations (PRs, commits, deploys) |
| 7 | **context-7** | Context7 library documentation lookup |
| 8 | **grafana-mcp** | Grafana dashboard and panel queries |
| 9 | **fire-console** | Wix Fire Console for site/service configuration inspection |

## Tool Naming Convention

MCP tools follow the pattern:

```
mcp__<server>__<tool>
```

Examples:
- `mcp__octocode__githubSearchCode`
- `mcp__grafana-datasource__query`
- `mcp__jira__getIssue`
- `mcp__Slack__search`
- `mcp__fire-console__inspect`

Always use the exact server name as registered in `core/mcp-servers.json`.
Server names are case-sensitive (`Slack`, not `slack`; `FT-release`, not
`ft-release`).

## Skill Files

Each MCP server has a corresponding skill file that documents available tools,
parameters, and usage patterns:

```
core/skills/<server>/SKILL.md
```

| Agent | Skill File(s) |
|-------|---------------|
| grafana-analyzer | `core/skills/grafana-datasource/SKILL.md` |
| codebase-semantics | `core/skills/octocode/SKILL.md` |
| slack-analyzer | `core/skills/slack/SKILL.md` |
| production-analyzer | `core/skills/github/SKILL.md` + `core/skills/ft-release/SKILL.md` |
| fix-list | `core/skills/ft-release/SKILL.md` |
| publisher | `core/skills/jira/SKILL.md` + `core/skills/slack/SKILL.md` |
| hypotheses / verifier | `core/skills/fire-console/SKILL.md` (on-demand domain queries) |

Load ALL skill files once at the start of an investigation (Step 0.5).
Do not re-read them for every agent launch.

## fire-console: No Authentication Required

The `fire-console` MCP server does NOT require a user access key. It connects
directly without authentication headers, unlike the other 8 servers which
require `<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>` to be configured.

This makes fire-console available out-of-the-box for configuration inspection
queries (site settings, service definitions, FT status on specific sites).
