# Autonomous Delivery

When handling implementation requests in this repo, run the full issue -> branch -> PR -> CI -> merge -> issue-close flow autonomously.

## Branch Hygiene

- If current branch/worktree appears unrelated to the new task, start from fresh `origin/main` on a new branch and continue.
- Do not block on confirmation for routine branch cleanup choices.
- Preserve unrelated user changes; do not revert or edit them.
- Only pause to ask when an action is destructive/irreversible or ambiguous in scope.

## Execution Expectations

- Open/confirm issue first.
- Implement end-to-end until merged when permissions allow.
- Resolve review comments before merge.
- Post summary back on issue and close it after checklist completion.
