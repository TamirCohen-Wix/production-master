# Plugins Deep Research Report

## Key takeaways

- Claude Code and Cursor plugin surfaces benefit from a shared command/agent contract with surface-specific UX wrappers.
- Plugin reliability depends on clear MCP setup, deterministic command behavior, and strict output contracts.
- Hook/rule orchestration should remain minimal and defer core logic to shared runtime modules.

## How to use this report

- Treat this file as the normalized entrypoint for plugin-platform research context.
- Use it as a concise summary for implementation planning and architecture decisions.
