# PR Review And Verification Discipline

Human purpose: ensure PRs are not merged with unresolved feedback or missing validation evidence.

## Applies When

- Any active pull request in this repository.

## Enforcement Guidance

- Query and monitor PR checks until completion; report actual status from fresh results before any completion claim.
- Resolve all review threads/comments before merge, including automated/Copilot review comments when present.
- If comments require code changes, update code, re-run relevant verification, and push follow-up commits.
- Keep the PR body and issue checklist consistent with final delivered scope.
- Include verification evidence in PR or issue updates (CI checks, tests, important manual validations).
