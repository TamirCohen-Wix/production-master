# Issue To Merge Workflow

Human purpose: enforce this repository's required execution flow for every implementation task.

## Applies When

- Any request that changes files, docs, scripts, or behavior in this repository.

## Enforcement Guidance

- Start by opening or confirming a GitHub issue with: scoped problem statement, TODO checklist, verification checklist, and context links.
- Implement from a dedicated branch/worktree that maps to exactly one PR.
- Open a PR referencing the issue and keep PR summary/test plan aligned to the issue checklist.
- Do not merge until required CI is green.
- After merge, update the issue with implementation summary and validation evidence, then mark checklist items done and close the issue.
