# Worktree And Merge Guardrails

Human purpose: prevent branch/worktree drift and enforce repository merge policy.

## Applies When

- Branch creation, PR merge, and post-merge cleanup operations.

## Enforcement Guidance

- Enforce `one PR = one branch = one worktree`; do not reuse stale worktrees.
- Merge strategy is squash merge into `main`.
- After merge, clean up in this order:
  1. verify PR merged to `main`,
  2. remove worktree,
  3. delete local branch,
  4. prune/fetch remote refs.
- Never delete a branch before removing its worktree.
- Do not claim task completion until cleanup and issue closure steps are done.
